# Viz Experiments
This repo is a collection of exercises and experiments in visualzation. This collection is inspired by visualizations that I want to replicate, packages that I want to try, or datasets that I want to explore.

To explore:

* Women's tennis grand slams, for [excellent table formatting](https://github.com/tashapiro/tanya-data-viz/blob/main/tennis/womens-tennis.R)
* FIFA TidyTuesday scatterplot that uses [flags for the points](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2022/week%2048%20FIFA%20world%20cup/FIFA%20world%20cup.R)
* Annual Google trends [ridgeplot](https://github.com/bydata/news_cycle_2022_de_google_trends)
* Explore [gghighlight::](https://yutannihilation.github.io/gghighlight/articles/gghighlight.html)
* [This](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/12_a_few_gg_packages/12_a_few_gg_packages.html#bump-charts) for bump charts, ggchicklet::, and camcorder::
* [This](https://github.com/SidhuK/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2022/38_December_27/starTrek.R) for code of waffle plot
* [This](https://github.com/camartinezbu/tidytuesday/blob/main/2022/2022-week49/plot_w49.R) for a nice rayshader:: example. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/@MrPecners) is a video.
* [This](https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2022/week%2052%20star%20trek/star%20trek.R) seems like a simpler way to render icons and fonts in text
* [This](https://milospopovic.net/crisp-topography-map-with-r/) is a great mapping tutorial
* ~~Need to learn Alt Text~~
* [This](https://www.business-science.io/r/2021/07/22/ggdist-raincloud-plots.html?utm_content=buffer4ad38&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) to try a rain cloud plot.
* [voteogram](https://t.co/KYUccl35HA) for Congressional vote data, and this [example](https://github.com/tashapiro/tanya-data-viz/blob/main/soth-election/scripts/soth-election.R) uses 'ggsankey::'
* [This](https://github.com/aliciaoberholzer/TidyTuesday/blob/main/Week1.R) map with WDI data (I'd like to review an example of my own side-by-side for ideas).

Project ideas:

* I'd like to use 'rayshader::' ([example](https://github.com/Pecners/rayshader_portraits) and [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8NV5MxcaWR4)) to build some population density maps ([data source](https://data.humdata.org/m/dataset/kontur-population-dataset?)) and I'd love to use a picture that I took in Uganda to extract a color palette (see the [eyedropper](http://gradientdescending.com/select-colours-from-an-image-in-r-with-eyedropper/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=select-colours-from-an-image-in-r-with-eyedropper) package)
* It would be fun to do a time-lapsed viz of Denver crimes since kickoff of Suoer Bowl Sunday nights, comparing crimes on the night of the loss and the night of the win. Are there dramatically different crime patterns?
* I'd like to try a circular visualization of Myles' Huckleberry data from his first year of sleep
* Something with 14ers would be fun (the above tutorial is about topo maps).
